Although there are existing methods for voice synthesis, the task of voice cloning is challenging because the model needs to adapt to an unseen speaker with very less data. Voice cloning is a relatively new task that has not received much attention until recently. While traditional text-to-speech (TTS) systems tries to aid man-machine interaction, voice cloning takes it a step further by enabling to replicate the voice of near or dear ones. However, it is practically difficult to gather large datasets for voice cloning in domestic environments. Apart from the major limitation of data unavailability, designing a compact, mobile, and efficient model for cloning voices with only a few samples of data remains an unaddressed problem. While voice cloning models continue to improve, it remains challenging to incorporate region-specific accents and indigenous low-resource languages into machine-generated audio outputs that accurately differentiate a human voice from a synthesized one. This is primarily because speech synthesis and cloning require a large amount of data, which is not available for low-resource languages. This work examines some preliminary results for voice cloning in Tamil. Despite being in the early stages, our results show promise for the development of a successful voice cloning system for Tamil. We believe that this work will serve as an invitation for the Tamil speech processing community to explore this exciting area of research further. With the potential to revolutionize the field of speech synthesis, voice cloning in Tamil could have significant implications for the development of speech-based applications and assistive technologies. The present work addresses the above-listed problems, specifically for Tamil.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2023</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div id="NFMD" class="col-sm-10"> <div class="title">Prospects of NFMD for Power System Frequency and Amplitude Estimation</div> <div class="author"> <em>Aadharsh Aadhithya</em>, Neethu Mohan, S Sachin Kumar, Soman K.P., and Prabhaharan.

Not only does it provide the theoretical substratum for the development of analytical algorithms it also lends the technological support for extremely efficient implementations. The linear algebra ecosystem consists of remarkably fast hardware support with equally efficient software solutions leveraging the hardware capacity. Graphs are an ubiquitous modelling framework for the representation and analysis of connected data.A flipside from practical perspective is that conventional graph algorithms are challenging as they are hard to parallelize and often make too much use of non-linear data structures which do not have hardware support. In this context, this paper presents an invitation to an alternate way to look at graph processing in terms of algebraic constructs, formulations and technology. The paper presents the theoretical underpinnings of the new view and also some interesting progresses at the frontier level in this direction. Above all, an intended objective is to present a compelling invite to the academia and research community to adopt this approach in their academic and research activities. </p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div id="pranav2023optimal" class="col-sm-10"> <div class="title">Optimal Perfect Phylogeny Using ILP and Continuous Approximations</div> <div class="author"> BE Pranav Kumaar, <em>Aadharsh Aadhithya</em>, S Sachin Kumar, Harishchander Anandaram, and KP Soman </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In International Conference on Advances in Computing and Data Sciences</em>, 2023 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-37940-6_11" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HTML</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>The concept of perfect phylogeny is observed to be non-universal, however, in some studies, it is shown that it provides great insights from a biological standpoint. Most natural phylogenies are imperfect but this is debated by the presence of noise in data acting as a disguise, the solution to uncover the underlying perfect phylogeny in the simplest approach is known as Minimum Character Removal (MCR) problem. Another variant of the solution achieved by a change in perspective and computational methodology is known as Maximal Character Compatibility (MCC) problem. Both MCR and MCC problems are solved optimally with reasonable efficiency by using Integer Linear Programming (ILP) technique. A central part of MCC solution involves solving the Max-clique problem of the generated representation allowing numerous clique-solving algorithms to generate various solutions. The comparison between the solution’s optimality and the run-time of these methods substantiates the goal of the different algorithms being applied. The above methods are formulated and implemented using modern programming languages like Python and Matlab.

Our analysis demonstrates that the ILP-based method is highly accurate but computationally expensive, whereas the NMF-based method is faster and more scalable but less accurate. The choice of method should depend on the specific research question and the size and complexity of the network being analyzed. We also highlight the need for further research to develop more efficient and accurate methods for identifying network motifs, especially for very large and complex networks. Understanding the significance of network motifs and their functions can lead to new therapeutic strategies and improved diagnostics for a wide range of diseases.In addition, we provide an easy-to-use Matlab code implementation for researchers to get started with analyzing their own network motifs. Our code is based on both the ILP-based method, and can be customized to suit the specific needs of the user.

The initial focus on Lagrangian relaxation for convex problems and decomposition strategies led to the refinement of methods like the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). The resurgence of interest in distributed optimization in the late 2000s, particularly in machine learning and imaging, demonstrated ADMM’s practical efficacy and its unifying potential. This overview also highlights the emergence of the proximal center method and its applications in diverse domains. Furthermore, the paper underscores the distinctive features of ALADIN, which offers convergence guarantees for non-convex scenarios without introducing auxiliary variables, differentiating it from traditional augmentation techniques.

It not only allows understanding public opinion on various issues, but also aids in monitoring real-time trends and sentiments, critical for domains such as brand management, market research, political campaign management, and crisis management. Central to the effectiveness of sentiment analysis is the extraction of meaningful features from the text data, with sentence embeddings being a vital component in capturing semantic relationships and sentence structures. This paper presents a novel approach to Twitter sentiment analysis that exploits sentence embeddings derived from Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD). DMD, a dimensionality reduction technique, enables us to capture the underlying dynamics of character transitions in tweets and to construct expressive sentence embeddings. The advantage of DMD lies in its ability to represent complex patterns and dependencies within the tweet text, thereby improving the richness of the derived sentence embeddings. Additionally, we investigate the use of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for sentiment classification, harnessing the power of relational modeling in the context of Twitter data. We also delve into word-level analysis with different emotion-based embeddings, assessing their impact on the sentiment classification performance. Our methodology integrates character-level analysis, graph-based modeling, and word-level semantics, providing a comprehensive, multi-layered approach to sentiment analysis on Twitter. Our experiments yield insightful results, highlighting the potential of DMD-based embeddings and the importance of high-quality, context-rich word embeddings in sentiment analysis tasks. These findings contribute to our understanding of sentiment analysis on social media platforms and suggest promising directions for future research in this field.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div id="reddy2023transfer" class="col-sm-10"> <div class="title">Transfer Learning Approach for Differentiating Parkinson’s Syndromes Using Voice Recordings</div> <div class="author"> N Sai Satwik Reddy, A Venkata Siva Manoj, V Poorna Muni Sasidhar Reddy, <em>Aadharsh Aadhithya</em>, and V Sowmya </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In International Advanced Computing Conference</em>, 2023 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-56703-2_18" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HTML</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Parkinson syndromes are a group of disorders affecting the elderly population with unsteadiness, slowness of activities, frequent falls, and speech disturbances, which slowly progress.

The current research provides a data-driven hybrid technique for the extraction of fundamental parameters using the Higher-order dynamic mode decomposition (HODMD) algorithm in smart grid. HODMD’s capacity to account for non-linearities enables it to produce accurate representations of the underlying dynamics, resulting in better model estimation. Thus, HODMD is an appropriate method for power quality analysis due to its capacity to analyze multidimensional data and non-uniformly sampled data. In this work, the potential of HODMD is examined for the estimation of fundamental frequency, amplitude, and the existence of disturbance components, such as harmonics. In the proposed methodology, HODMD modes are computed using the low-rank approximation and then extracted the amplitude and frequency information from the data. The hyper parameters of the proposed methodology are properly tuned to get an accurate estimate of the underlying parameters. The optimistic results on various synthetic and real-time scenarios indicate that the proposed methodology can be utilized to determine the power system frequency and amplitude in general periodic and quasi-periodic dynamics.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2021</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div id="9673636" class="col-sm-10"> <div class="title">Implementation of Hack ALU using Quantum Dot Cellular Automata</div> <div class="author"> <em>Aadharsh Aadhithya</em>, J.

As researchers continue to work hard to find an alternative to CMOS technology, QCA provides a solution for a faster computer with a smaller size and low power consumption. This paper implements an operation-rich “HACK ALU”, capable of performing many operations. Hack AL U is a versatile design that implements 64 op-erations with just 6 control bits along with novel implementations of adders and multiplexers. This ALU has been designed using a bottom-up approach by beginning the design by constructing the basic gates and progressing to the construction of adders, and multiplexers. The scope of the research is to provide an efficient ALU design that can be integrated in the CPU design. The present work has been implemented and tested on the QCA designer software.
